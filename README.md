# Mapping_Earthquakes

### Purpose
The goal of this analysis is to generate a map that shows earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates' location on the earth.
We are to have toggle options to show all earthquakes, as well as all major earthquakes that have a magnitude greater than 4.5. We are also to have 3 base map options.

We will be doing all of this using our knowledge of Javascript, D3, JSON, Leaflet and HTML.

### Results

The first deliverable was to set up our two base maps and add the tectonic plates as well as all of the earthquakes.
The image below shows reference to that.


The second deliverable was to add an option to see only the major earthquakes. The image below shows that on our second style of map.



The final deliverable was to add a 3rd style option for the maap. You can see it below.
